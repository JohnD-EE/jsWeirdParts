/**
 * Classical Vs Prototypal Inheritance:
 *  - Inheritance
 *    - one object gets access to the properites and methods of another object.
 *  - Classical Inheritance
 *    - commonly use in classical programming such as java, c++, php, etc
 *    - considered verbose, uses friend, protected, private, interface
 *  - Protypal Inheritance
 *    - Simple, flexible, extensible and easy to understand
 *    - two patterns of prototypal inheritance
 *        - prototypal pattern of prototypal inheritance
 *        - the constructor pattern of prototypal inheritance
 *    - there are two ways of creating objects using prototypal inheritance
 *        - create a brand new object.
 *        - clone an existing object and extend it
 *  - good explanation found here:
 *    http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2800964/benefits-of-prototypal-inheritance-over-classical
 *
 * Prototype:
 *  - all functions and arrays have prototype pointing to an object with those function methods
 *    -  see line 26 ex: /E2_UnderstandingThePrototype
 *
 * Reflection:
 *  - an object can look at itself, listing, and changing its properties and methods
